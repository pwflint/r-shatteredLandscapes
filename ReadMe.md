Working through the process outlined in Danielle Navarro's [Shattered Landscapes](https://blog.djnavarro.net/posts/2023-03-13_shattered-landscapes/) project. Each script represents a heading in the tutorial. I am interested in this process as a demonstration of the artistic capabilities of the `ambient` package and to build familiarity with `rayshader` outside of spatial data sets. I suspect I will apply the principles of each package to separate domains in future projects, but it is worth exploring them used together to help build capacity with working across various methods. 

In general, when working with new material, I will follow the steps in a tutorial to the letter while tweaking variables I understand or working with a different data set. This helps ensure that the code delivers the expected output and errors are due to my own misunderstanding. For example, in this project I have only initially adjusted the `seed` value, while in the `Canopy-Height` tutorial I worked with a data set from North Carolina. Once I am confident that I have mastered the principles involved I will begin to adjust values in various arguments so I understand exactly what each argument does.

Notes in these types of auto-didactic projects are here in the ReadMe or made to myself inside scripts. The plan is to compile and revise notes to publish into a "work in public" site that is currently under construction.
